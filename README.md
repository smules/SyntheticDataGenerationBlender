# SyntheticDataGenerationBlender - LEGO
This is a Blender script with the sole purpose of mass producing Domain Randomized. The purpose is to train TensorFlow to identify LEGO pieces.

First download generate_images.py. Open the .py file and configure it to your specs, like resolution and model directory. You will also have to dowload the LDraw library of models, and the loadldraw add-on, which enables you to load you LDraw files into Blender.
#### Finally, when you are ready to start the program, open Blender
Click on the scripting tab on the top and load the .py file. Run the script
